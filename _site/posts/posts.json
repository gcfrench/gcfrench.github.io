    "description": "This week I thought I would explore the use of gganimate package to animate a ggplot graph. Connor Rothschild's, a undergraduate at Rice University, has created an excellent 2019 week 41 TidyTuesday submission, producing an animated line graph showing the differences between men and women's heaviest lifts. This used both the ggplot2 and gganimate package so I thought I would work through his code to start to understand how to apply animation to a ggplot.",

The code with the UK base map is there in case it is useful in the future!",
